#
#     shape = "Block" | "Underline" | "Beam"
#
#         Default: "Block"
#
#     blinking = "Never" | "Off" | "On" | "Always"
#
#         Never
#
#             Prevent the cursor from ever blinking

#
# TERMINAL
#
# This section documents the [terminal] table of the configuration file.
#
# shell = "<string>" | { program = "<string>", args = ["<string>",] }
#
#     You can set shell.program to the path of your favorite shell, e.g. /bin/zsh. Entries in shell.args are passed as arguments to the shell.
#
#     Default:
#
#         Linux/BSD/macOS: $SHELL or the user's login shell, if $SHELL is unset
#         Windows: "powershell"
#
#     Example:
#
#         shell = { program = "/bin/zsh", args = ["-l"] }
#
# osc52 = "Disabled" | "OnlyCopy" | "OnlyPaste" | "CopyPaste"
#
#     Controls the ability to write to the system clipboard with the OSC 52 escape sequence. While this escape sequence is useful to copy contents from the remote server, allowing any application to read from the clipboard can be easily abused while not providing significant benefits over explicitly pasting text.
#
#     Default: "OnlyCopy"
#
# MOUSE
#
# This section documents the [mouse] table of the configuration file.
#
# hide_when_typing = true | false
#
#     When this is true, the cursor is temporarily hidden when typing.
#
#     Default: false
#
# bindings = [{ <mouse>, <mods>, <mode>, <command> | <chars> | <action> },]
#
#     See keyboard.bindings for full documentation on mods, mode, command, chars, and action.
#
#     When an application running within Alacritty captures the mouse, the `Shift` modifier can be used to suppress mouse reporting. If no action is found for the event, actions for the event without the `Shift` modifier are triggered instead.
#
#     mouse = "Middle" | "Left" | "Right" | "Back" | "Forward" | <integer>
#
#         Mouse button which needs to be pressed to trigger this binding.
#
#     action = <keyboard.bindings.action> | "ExpandSelection"
#
#         ExpandSelection
#
#             Expand the selection to the current mouse cursor location.
#
#     Example:
#
#         [mouse]
#         bindings = [
#         { mouse = "Right", mods = "Control", action = "Paste" },
#         ]
#
# HINTS
#
# This section documents the [hints] table of the configuration file.
#
# Terminal hints can be used to find text or hyperlinks in the visible part of the terminal and pipe it to other applications.
#
# alphabet = "<string>"
#
#     Keys used for the hint labels.
#
#     Default: "jfkdls;ahgurieowpq"
#
# enabled = [{ <regex>, <hyperlinks>, <post_processing>, <persist>, <action>, <command>, <binding>, <mouse> },]
#
# Array with all available hints.
#
# Each hint must have at least one of regex or hyperlinks and either an action or a command.
#
#     regex = "<string>"
#
#         Regex each line will be compared against.
#
#     hyperlinks = true | false
#
#         When this is true, all OSC 8 escape sequence hyperlinks will be included in the hints.
#
#     post_processing = true | false
#
#         When this is true, heuristics will be used to shorten the match if there are characters likely not to be part of the hint (e.g. a trailing .). This is most useful for URIs and applies only to regex matches.
#
#     persist = true | false
#
#         When this is true, hints remain persistent after selection.
#
#     action = "Copy" | "Paste" | "Select" | "MoveViModeCursor"
#
#         Copy
#
#             Copy the hint's text to the clipboard.
#
#         Paste
#
#             Paste the hint's text to the terminal or search.
#
#         Select
#
#             Select the hint's text.
#
#         MoveViModeCursor
#
#             Move the vi mode cursor to the beginning of the hint.
#
#     command = "<string>" | { program = "<string>", args = ["<string>",] }
#
#         Command which will be executed when the hint is clicked or selected with the binding.
#
#         The hint's text is always attached as the last argument.
#
#     binding = { key = "<string>", mods = "<string>", mode = "<string>" }
#
#         See keyboard.bindings for documentation on available values.
#
#         This controls which key binding is used to start the keyboard hint selection process.
#
#     mouse = { mods = "<string>", enabled = true | false }
#
#         See keyboard.bindings for documentation on available mods.
#
#         The enabled field controls if the hint should be underlined when hovering over the hint text with all mods pressed.
#
#     Default:
#
#         [[hints.enabled]]
#         command = "xdg-open" # On Linux/BSD
#         # command = "open" # On macOS
#         # command = { program = "cmd", args = [ "/c", "start", "" ] } # On Windows
#         hyperlinks = true
#         post_processing = true
#         persist = false

# KEYBOARD
#
# This section documents the [keyboard] table of the configuration file.
#
# bindings = [{ <key>, <mods>, <mode>, <command> | <chars> | <action> },]
#
#     To unset a default binding, you can use the action "ReceiveChar" to remove it or "None" to inhibit any action.
#
#     Multiple keybindings can be triggered by a single key press and will be executed in the order they are defined in.
#
#     key = "<string>"
#
#         The regular keys like "A", "0", and "Я" can be mapped directly without any special syntax. Full list of named keys like "F1" and the syntax for dead keys can be found here:

#
#         Numpad keys are prefixed by Numpad: "NumpadEnter" | "NumpadAdd" | "NumpadComma" | "NumpadDecimal" | "NumpadDivide" | "NumpadEquals" | "NumpadSubtract" | "NumpadMultiply" | "Numpad[0-9]".
#
#         The key field also supports using scancodes, which are specified as a decimal number.
#
#     mods = "Command" | "Control" | "Option" | "Super" | "Shift" | "Alt"
#
#         Multiple modifiers can be combined using |, like this: "Control | Shift".
#
#     mode = "AppCursor" | "AppKeypad" | "Search" | "Alt" | "Vi"
#
#         This defines a terminal mode which must be active for this binding to have an effect.
#
#         Prepending ~ to a mode will require the mode to not = be active for the binding to take effect.
#
#         Multiple modes can be combined using |, like this: "~Vi|Search".
#
#     command = "<string>" | { program = "<string>", args = ["<string>",] }
#
#         Fork and execute the specified command.
#
#     chars = "<string>"

# DEBUG
#
# This section documents the [debug] table of the configuration file.
